<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This is the <em>Toejam &amp; Earl Seeded World Generator</em>! It
takes the original <em>Toejam &amp; Earl</em> game for the Sega Genesis,
and applies new seeds. This allows different players to race each other
using consistent seeds.</p>

<p>This is a web-based patching system for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive ROMs; the
patching is done entirely in your web browser using the power of JavaScript.
(No ROMs are uploaded or downloaded in this process.) In order to use it, you
will need a ROM for <em>Toejam &amp; Earl</em>. If you do not have such a ROM,
and you are on Windows, you can purchase it from Steam as
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/71166/ToeJam__Earl/">one of the
SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics</a>. Once installed, the file you need is at <code>&lt;Steam
Directory&gt;\SteamApps\common\Sega Classics\uncompressed ROMs\ToeJamEarl.SGD</code>.</p>

<p>The ROM data will be stored in your web browser's offline storage for
future use.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

The base game includes both a "Random World" game and a "Fixed World" game.
The "Fixed World" uses predefined values for all the level seeds and ship
piece locations. We merely patch in our own values, and then rewrite the
menu so that "Fixed World" becomes "Seeded World", so that the maps and
ship piece locations will be consistent between runs.

Note that, just like in a Fixed World game, the present appearances and
earthling locations are still randomized.

<h2>But then can't someone cheat by forcing a good seed?</h2>

<p>The main menu is modified to include both the seed identifier and the
version of the generator. Most places where someone would care about
"cheating"-- that is, races and the <a
href="https://www.speedrun.com/ToeJam_and_Earl">speedrun.com
leaderboards</a>-- require streaming or video evidence, including the
menu at game start.</p>

<p>Seeded World runs should not be considered as valid for submission for
either the Fixed World or Random World leaderboards.</p>

<h2>What version of the game do I need?</h2>

<p>For this system, either REV 00 or REV 02 is acceptable. (The version from
Steam is REV 02.)</p>

<p>There are no known gameplay differences between the two versions.</p>
